"""Fab file to generate a .tgz archive file.

The contents of the "web_static" folder from my AirBnB clone repo are used
for the archive file.
Details:
    - All files in the folder web_static is added to the final archive.
    - All archives are stored in the folder versions
        (the function creates this folder if it doesnâ€™t exist).
    - The name of the created archive will be:
        web_static_<year><month><day><hour><minute><second>.tgz
    - The function do_pack must return the archive path if the archive
        has been correctly generated. Otherwise, it will return None.
